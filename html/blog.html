		<h2><br>What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?<br></h2>
		<p>
			Robots.txt is a simple text file in your site root, www.mypage.com/robots.txt. Web site owners use the
			robots.txt file to give instructions about their website to web robots. It is called The Robots Exclusion Protocol.
			A robot wants to visit a certain website URL, before it does that it checks the robots.txt file, if that website
			has one. It finds things like, User-agent, Disallow and allow.
			User-agent: Means this section applies to all robots. 
			Disallow: Tells the robot which pages or any page at the site. If you write Disallow /html/contact.html you
			are not allowed to enter that page. 
			Allow: And of course this is which pages your are allowed to visit.

		<h2><br>Why is it important to seperate the layout and design (css) from content (html)?<br></h2>
		<p>
			Because the code becomes easier to read for other develepors and it is easier to maintain a good 
			structure in your code. With an external css file, the style can be reusable. Smaller projects with a couple html
			files can have only one css file, but when projects become massive it is maybe better to have a couple of css files, 
			just to mantain good structure. It has an impact on performance, smaller code chunks are loaded faster, and that
			is also a reason to only have one css file, browsers will cache css files resulting in quicker loading.
