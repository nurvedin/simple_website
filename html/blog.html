		<h2><br>What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?<br></h2>
		<p>
			Robots.txt is a simple text file in your site root, www.mypage.com/robots.txt. Web site owners use the
			robots.txt file to give instructions about their website to web robots. It is called The Robots Exclusion Protocol.
			A robot wants to visit a certain website URL, before it does that it checks the robots.txt file, if that website
			has one. It finds things like, User-agent, Disallow and allow.
			User-agent: Means this section applies to all robots. 
			Disallow: Tells the robot which pages or any page at the site. If you write Disallow /html/contact.html you
			are not allowed to enter that page. 
			Allow: And of course this is which pages your are allowed to visit.
